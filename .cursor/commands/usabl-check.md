# usabl-check

Run `npx usabl check --self-check` from the repository root.

Report:

1. The verdict.
2. The affected accessibility behavior.
3. The first finding and suggested repair, when present.
4. Any missing coverage.

This is an on-demand self-check the assistant runs during implementation. It is
advisory. Do not call the work verified from this command alone. The accessibility
gate (`usabl check` / CI) decides proof.
